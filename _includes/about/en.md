I'm a software engineer with extensive experience (6-years) in **Process Automation, Firmware Development & Data Science**. I use Python daily and I really enjoy **Pythonic** way of programming. I also do lots of work in C/C++, MySQL, MATLAB/OCTAVE, VB.NET and several other languages.

Experienced in desktop application using Qt framework (`pyqt`) and VB.NET, different hardware interfacing protocals (`GPIB`, `I2C`, `RS232` etc), databases (`MySQL Connector/Python`), machine learning (`scikit-learn, tensorflow etc`),  data analysis & visualization(`pandas & matplotlib`) and firmware development (`C/C++`, & `Python-C intefacing` using `ctypes` etc).

Currently focusing on deepen my knowledge on Python by "reinventing the wheel" *(yes, that's right, it could help me deepen my knowledge on the lower level stuffs)*,  and learning full stack web application development during my spare time. 

I'm currently also aiming at getting my very first [tag:python] Silver badge->[Gold badge](http://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/51/python);)
